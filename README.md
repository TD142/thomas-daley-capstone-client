## Interacting with the Music

Click on a sampler pad to trigger a sound clip. Once actioned the selected pad will turn blue. to stop the track, click again, the pad will flash a red border and the audio will then fade out. Once the sound clip audio has stopped, the pad will return to its default white color.

Fade in or out the individual sound clips with the blue faders placed beneath the pads.

The individual tracks have been designed in a way to fit with each other no matter the time they are triggered. Experiment and see what you can come up with!
